# LaunchMind 🚀  
**Your idea’s first checkpoint.**  

LaunchMind is a lightweight MVP project that allows users to evaluate their business ideas using AI. The platform collects essential information about a startup idea through a simple form, and then gives a visual feedback on the potential success using OpenAI's language models.

## 🌟 MVP Purpose

This is the initial version of the project focused on:

- Simple and user-friendly input form (HTML)
- Flask backend to handle form submissions
- Integration with OpenAI API to analyze and score the idea
- Displaying the result visually without needing a full backend infrastructure

> ⚠️ Note: No database or user login system is included at this stage.
